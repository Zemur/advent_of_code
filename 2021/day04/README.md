Day 04

This one took longer than I wanted it too.
I'm not particularly proud of it, but I also worked on it while recovering from my third covid vaccine. The fever plus
brain fog caused some strange decisions in the code like actually writing `BingoCard.pretty_print()`, the ansi coding to
actually bold the numbers, and the regex to strip the very same encoding from the marked numbers.
